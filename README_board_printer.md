# Update play.js: Board Display and Move Checking

## Solution for Displaying the Board:

- Used two nested loops with `.map()` and joined elements with spaces for display.

## Solution for Move Checking:

- Used `flatMap()` to combine the array and find `"_"` to detect available moves.

## Additional Updates:

- Commented out the `while` loop for testing.
- Removed comments and restored the code in the updated version.
